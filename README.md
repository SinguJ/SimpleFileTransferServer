# SimpleFileTransferServer

[简体中文](README.SimplifiedChinese.md)  [繁體中文](README.TraditionalChinese.md)

This is a console program that starts an HTTP-based file transfer service in the run directory, allowing others to browse and download all files in your run directory as if they were using a network disk.

## How to use

### Start the service

Download the version suitable for your current system from the release page, then extract the executable program inside, and finally run it in the directory you want to share (Linux or MacOS needs to increase the execute permission).

### Download file

Open your browser, then visit `http://127.0.0.1:7464` and click on the file you want to download.

(Under the LAN sharing, you need to replace the IP with your IP address under the LAN)
